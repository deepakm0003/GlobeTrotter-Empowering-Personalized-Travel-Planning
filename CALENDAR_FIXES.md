# Calendar Event Management - Fixes Applied

## Problem
The calendar page was showing an error "Please fill in all required fields" when trying to add events, even when the form was filled out. The issue was that the system required both a trip AND a destination/stop to be selected, but many trips don't have stops configured yet.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoints
Added new calendar event management endpoints in `server/index.js`:

- `POST /api/calendar/events` - Create new calendar event
- `PUT /api/calendar/events/:activityId` - Update existing event
- `DELETE /api/calendar/events/:activityId` - Delete event
- `GET /api/calendar/events/:tripId` - Fetch events for a trip

### 2. Frontend API Functions
Added calendar API functions in `src/data/mockData.ts`:

- `createCalendarEvent()` - Create new event
- `updateCalendarEvent()` - Update existing event
- `deleteCalendarEvent()` - Delete event
- `fetchCalendarEvents()` - Fetch events for a trip

### 3. Calendar Component Updates
Modified `src/components/Calendar/TripCalendar.tsx`:

- Made destination/stop selection optional
- Updated validation to only require trip and event name
- Changed warning message to be more informative
- Added proper error handling and success messages
- Implemented backend integration for CRUD operations

### 4. Key Changes Made

#### Validation Logic
```typescript
// Before: Required trip, stop, and name
if (!newEvent.tripId || !newEvent.stopId || !newEvent.name) {
  toast.error('Please fill in all required fields');
  return;
}

// After: Only requires trip and name
if (!newEvent.tripId || !newEvent.name) {
  toast.error('Please fill in all required fields');
  return;
}
```

#### Destination Selection
```typescript
// Before: Required field with error message
<label>Select Destination *</label>
<div className="text-amber-400">No destinations found for this trip.</div>

// After: Optional field with helpful message
<label>Select Destination (Optional)</label>
<div className="text-blue-400">No destinations configured for this trip. You can still add events without selecting a destination.</div>
```

#### Backend Integration
- Events are now saved to the database via API calls
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Automatic refresh of trip data after adding events

## How to Test

1. **Start the servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd server && npm start
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Calendar page:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5175/calendar`
   - Click "Add Event" button

3. **Test adding events:**
   - Select any trip (even one without destinations)
   - Fill in event name and other details
   - Click "Add Event" - should work without requiring destination

4. **Verify in database:**
   - Check server console for activity creation logs
   - Events are saved to the `Activity` table in the database

## Database Schema
Events are stored in the `Activity` table with the following structure:
- `id` - Auto-incrementing primary key
- `name` - Event name
- `description` - Event description
- `category` - Event category (sightseeing, food, etc.)
- `cost` - Event cost
- `duration` - Event duration in hours
- `cityId` - Associated city (defaults to 1)
- `isBooked` - Booking status

## Future Improvements
1. Add proper relationship between trips and activities
2. Implement activity-specific dates (currently uses stop dates)
3. Add activity editing functionality
4. Implement drag-and-drop reordering
5. Add activity categories and filtering
